		<h1>test content </h1>
		<p>
		Stylish Star Allu Arjun and gorgeous beauty Shruti Haasan have teamed up for the commercial entertainer, ‘Race Gurram’. The movie has released across the world today and Surender Reddy has directed it. The film has been produced by Nallamalupu Bujji. Let us check out the movie now.
		</p>
		<h3>Story :</h3>
		<p>
		Lucky (Allu Arjun) is a carefree guy who lives a relaxed life. His character is a complete contrast of his brother Ram (Shyam), who is a dedicated ACP. The two of them think very differently and they keep having petty quarrels.
		</p>
		<p>
		Lucky comes across Spandana and it is love at first sight for the hero. He sets out to woo her and hangs out with his Babai (M.S. Narayana). This carefree life is disrupted when Ram decides to oppose a corrupt and evil politician named Siva Reddy (Ravi Kishan).
		</p>
		<p>
		Siva Reddy does not hesitate to kill his opponents and Ram is on the hit list. This is accidentally discovered by Lucky and he decides to teach Siva Reddy a lesson. He warns the politician to stay away from his family.
		</p>
		<p>
		An enraged Siva Reddy decides to take revenge on Lucky’s family and he uses all his powers to harass them. Lucky then decides to fight back in his own way, with the help of Govardhan (Posani Krishna Murali). He has Kill Bill Pandey (Brahmanandam) for company.
		</p>
		<p>
		How Lucky manages to thwart Siva Reddy is what this story is all about.
		</p>
		<h3>Plus Points :</h3>
		<p>
		Allu Arjun is improving as an actor with every film and this film is an example. He has done a superb job in this movie and his performance is a big asset. Bunny’s comedy timing is spot on in the film. He has come up with some superb dance moves for the film.
		</p>
		<p>
		Shruti Haasan does not have much to do but she has very good screen presence. Her glamorous avatar is a big attraction for the masses. Saloni is ok as Shyam’s romantic interest.
		</p>
		<p>
		Brahmanandam has delivered another knock out performance as ‘Kill Bill Pandey’. He enters the film in the second half and manages to come up with a hilarious performance that will have good repeat value. Posani entertains in a nice role.
		</p>

		<p>
		Ali and M.S. Narayan have performed well. Shyam is good as the honest ACP. Ravi Kishan makes a good impression as the villainous MLA. Emotional scenes in the movie, especially the scenes where brotherly love is highlighted, have come out well.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are a few good twists and unexpected sequences in the film and they are nice.
		</p>
		<h3>Minus Points :</h3>
		<p>The story is quite boring. There is some similarity to ‘Lakshyam’. The movie also gets predictable at times.</p>
		<p>
		The movie is a little big too long and it should have been trimmed by about 20 minutes atleast. Most of this trimming should have been in the first half.</p>
		<p>
		Though songs are good, none of them have a good lead. As a result, promising songs like ‘Down Down Duppa’ are wasted. They simply hamper the flow of the story.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Technical Aspects :</h3>
		<p>
		Cinematography is good and visuals look bright and colourful. Editor has done a very average job and he should have been more effective in the first half. Dialogues are pretty good. Thaman lifts the film with some solid back ground music in the second half.
		</p>
		<p>
		Surender Reddy’s direction is ok. He has played a safe game this time, rather than trying out something radically new.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Verdict :
		</h3>
		<p>
		‘Race Gurram’ is a paisa vasool entertainer that makes you feel good when you walk out of the theatre. Brahmanandam, Ali, Posani and M.S.Narayana will make sure that you have a good time. Allu Arjun has improved tremendously as an actor and this movie is going to be one of his best commercial hits.
